There are twenty countries. Your goal is to guess their capitals. You have only five attempts. 
There are two types of failures. The first is you didn't guess or typed it wrong. But you are allowed to input a first letter with lowercase. You also can input a string without space if it consists of two words. 
The second failure is you skipped a country or pressed "New country" before "Check" even if you was right.
